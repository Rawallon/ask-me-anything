## üéØ About

Ask Me Anything is a platform built to let you gather questions from your viewers during your stream and let them vote for which are the best questions for you to answer.<br/>
Ask me Anything started out in Rocketseat's NLW Together Bootcamp, but since I liked the idea for an Q&A platform I took as a challange to redesign it and its functionalities<br/><br/>
Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would appreciate it a lot.
